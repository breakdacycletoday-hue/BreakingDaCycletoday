<h2>Your Story</h2>
<p>This journey began with a simple moment. A walk that became a jog. A jog that became clarity. Break Da Cycle started the moment you realized you had waited too long to take care of yourself and your dreams.</p>
<p>Your transformation came from discipline, recovery, humor, mistakes, and reflection. At Freeman Lake, you learned that you do not need to move like the man you once were. You only need to move at your pace. Consistently. Intentionally.</p>
<p>The second shift came in the shower, during a long meditation. You reflected on your life, your purpose, and how you wanted to help others while caring for your own health, mind, and faith. You drew an hourglass on the mirror as a reminder that time is always passing. The goal is not to stop it, but to fill it with meaningful actions.</p>
<p>From these moments, Break Da Cycle was born.</p>
